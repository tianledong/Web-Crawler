1. Our high-level approach is to list and analyze the high-level requirements, and then give the general process of
the whole program, like the order of function calls and where to handle exceptions. Also, we study and discuss about the
structure of HTML methods and how to write cookie information as well as login credentials.

2. The biggest challenge we faced was handling the format of HTML headers. It took the major part of our time to debug
and fix our headers. Besides, we spent a lot of time on parsing the HTML file and locating the links and secret flags.

3. We test our code by running it multiple times and see if there is any exceptions or errors we didn't consider.

4. Both of us spent lots of effort on collaborating and coding together, and Tianle wrote the major part of building
HTML methods and handling HTML status code, and Siyuan wrote the major part of parsing the HTML files and the algorithm
of crawling the web page.
